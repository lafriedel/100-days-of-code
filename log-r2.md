The log of my second #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Monday, June 11, 2018].

## Log

### R2D1 (6/11/18)
I listened to Lambda School's Web Dev 101 bootcamp and did their homework. Just a review, but I'm mainly here to review some Javascript concepts and also wanted to get a taste of the new bootcamp structure. Additionally I began reading You Don't Know JS: Up and Going.

### R2D2 (6/12/18)
I listened to Lambda School's Web Dev 101 Bootcamp on CSS...also read some of Clean Code.


### R2D3 (6/13/18)
I listened to Lambda School's Web Dev 101 Bootcamp on Intro to Javascript, just refreshing my knowledge of fundamentals. Then checked out freeCodeCamp's updated curriculum - filled some newly created holes in areas I had previously finished, and started on their ES6 section.
