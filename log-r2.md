The log of my second #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Monday, June 11, 2018].

## Log

### R2D1 (6/11/18)
I listened to Lambda School's Web Dev 101 bootcamp and did their homework. Just a review, but I'm mainly here to review some Javascript concepts and also wanted to get a taste of the new bootcamp structure. Additionally I began reading You Don't Know JS: Up and Going.

### R2D2 (6/12/18)
I listened to Lambda School's Web Dev 101 Bootcamp on CSS...also read some of Clean Code.


### R2D3 (6/13/18)
I listened to Lambda School's Web Dev 101 Bootcamp on Intro to Javascript, just refreshing my knowledge of fundamentals. Then checked out freeCodeCamp's updated curriculum - filled some newly created holes in areas I had previously finished, and started on their ES6 section.

### R2D4 (6/14/18)
Listened to Lambda School's bootcamp to review if/else, scope, and control flow.

### R2D5 (6/15/18)
I worked through some of freeCodeCamp's ES6 section. Getting stuck on writing higher order arrow functions -- higher order functions are still giving me a bit of trouble.

### R2D6 (6/16/18)
Frustrated by my block on higher order arrow functions, I went back to CSS and worked through a large chunk of freeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design section.

### R2D7 (6/18/18)
I continued work on the Applied Visual Design section - loved learning about CSS animation!

### R2D8 (6/19/18)
Finished up the Applied Visual Design section and moved onto Applied Accessibility.

### R2D9 (6/20/18)
Finished the Applied Accessibility section on freeCodeCamp.

### R2D10 (6/23/18)
Skipped 2 days so worked a bit longer to make up for it. I worked through the Responsive Web Design Principles, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid sections on freeCodeCamp. Started laying out the survey form challenge HTML on Codepen.

### R2D11 (6/24/18)
Continued to work on the survey form challenge. I'm focusing on proper accessibility. I'll move onto styling soon.

### R2D12 (6/25/18)
I began styling the form. Trying to make it efficient! I'm learning that some form elements are tricky to style.
