# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: 1/8/18

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the freeCodeCamp exercises. Got up to integrating Bootstrap into the first project, the CatPhotoApp.

**Thoughts:** Everything covered so far has been basically a review for me, but I'm glad to have it. I'm looking forward to working past the stuff I already know.

### R1D2: 1/9/18

**Today's Progress**: Got through the Bootstrap and jQuery intro on freeCodeCamp, and I'm just about to start my first CodePen project as part of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was my first experience with jQuery, so even though it was super basic I feel good. I need to think of who I'd like to feature on my CodePen project, which is a tribute page.

### R1D3: 1/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I began doing research and setting up the HTML structure for my tribute page. Unsurprisingly (to people who know me), this tribute page is about parrots.

**Thoughts:** Coding a project is very different than doing exercises. I sat down to start coding it and I was like, "wait, what do I do?" But now that I'm mostly set up with some very basic HTML, I'm looking forward to making it a little more sophisticated and customizing it with CSS.

### R1D4: 1/11/18

**Today's Progress**: I started styling my tribute page with custom CSS as well as some Bootstrap styles. I used some things learned in freeCodeCamp as well as researched how to do some new things.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good - I'd like to finish this project up tomorrow so I can move on. I'm struggling to figure out how to best position the title font so that it layer over the header image and can be properly responsive, and that caught me up a bit.

### R1D5: 1/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished up my tribute page project; I utilized a bit more Bootstrap. I then began the personal portfolio page project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I did figure out eventually how to layer the text over the image, but realized it wasn't a good solution. I came up with a new solution for the page header that I'm happy with. It felt good to finish a project, even though it was very simple and small.

**Link to Work:** [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/ZvreXb)

### R1D6: 1/13/18

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Bootstrap today to add content to my personal portfolio page.  

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying seeing how code works and doesn't work. It's like a puzzle.

### R1D7: 1/14/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with Bootstrap. Began implementing Bootstrap forms and nav. Also learned more about customizing Font Awesome icons.  

**Thoughts:** 7-day streak! Yay! I really like Bootstrap. I appreciate its ease of use and it's ability to be easily customized.

**Link to Work:** [Personal Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/MrXYZd)

### R1D8: 1/15/18

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio page: Correctly coded my hero image with text layering and added in-page navigation.

**Thoughts:** Slightly frustrated with the hero image. I tried adding my headshot with my name and tagline next to it but I'm having trouble getting it to look right. The image size is mostly the issue. I want to spend time getting it to work properly.

### R1D9: 1/16/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** I feel like there are some general layout/positioning things in CSS that I need to better understand. That's mostly what I've been having trouble with in my coding. I wanted to finish up this project and move on for now, though; I do think I'll go back to these first two projects and rebuild them as my knowledge grows.

### R1D10: 1/17/18

**Today's Progress**: Began the Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Math! I like math. Javascript is definitely more challenging for me than HTML/CSS, and I'm looking forward to feeling comfortable with it. (Also, 10% of the way through 100 days!)

### R1D11: 1/18/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp: arrays, manipulating arrays, passing arguments into functions.

**Thoughts:** Ugh, I am stuck on a challenge involving queues. It's frustrating - Javascript definitely doesn't come as naturally to me as visual things like HTML and CSS. But I'm working on it - I absolutely want to understand and feel comfortable with Javascript.

### R1D12: 1/19/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp: more mathematical operators, if/else statements, and just beginning switch statements.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit more confident today. I caved and looked up the answer to the previous JS challenge. It was a simple solution; I'm thinking the wording of the challenge got me tripped up. Still, I should probably spend more time with .push() and .shift().

### R1D13: 1/20/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp: switch statements, returning boolean values, and working with objects.

**Thoughts:** It went ok today. I'm starting to understand the logic of JS a bit better. 

### R1D14: 1/21/18

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Javascript on freeCodeCamp. Today it was accessing information in objects, nested objects, and nested arrays, and I began working with for loops.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about it. Although I know when I get to the first project challenge using Javascript, there's going to be a dip in my confidence for sure! 

### R1D15: 1/22/18

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Javascript on freeCodeCamp. More work with for loops, nested for loops, while loops.

**Thoughts:** I'm realizing my logic is there, but my syntax/code isn't correct all the time. For example, I had to access a property within an array and I forgot that .hasOwnProperty exists, so I tried accessing it in a different way. But at least I knew I had to access it! I'm getting there.

### R1D16: 1/23/18

**Today's Progress**: Lots more work with Javascript. Worked with regular expressions and different array and string methods.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. But tomorrow starts the Javascript challenges, where one must solve the problems from scratch. Aye! I will get through it though.

### R1D17: 1/24/18

**Today's Progress**: I completed two algorithm challenges on freeCodeCamp. Reversing a string and factorializing a number.

**Thoughts:** ...I actually completed two challenges!! I looked up the answer afterwards to compare what I did - my code is a bit convoluted, but it got there! I'll get better and more efficient as time goes by and as I remember the full functionality of certain code.

### R1D18: 1/25/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a palindrome algorithm on freeCodeCamp. I'm nearly there. Still need to return a few different options as "true" that are currently returning "false."

**Thoughts:** My code is so not efficient. I guess I didn't realize I could combine multiple methods, for some reason. I'm going to return to the code tomorrow and clean it up.

### R1D19: 1/26/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked through a couple more algorithms in freeCodeCamp: Check for palindromes and find the longest word in a string.

**Thoughts:** Even though I got through them I had to look up lots of hints. I think I'm going to go back and redo some of these. Seems like I'm still not grasping some basic concepts. It might be helpful for me to do some supplemental reading as well.

### R1D20: 1/28/18

**Today's Progress**: I went back to the first algorithm to start working through them again. I want to make sure I understand the concepts without having to look up answer hints. I got through reversing a string, and I'm continuing to retry the factorializing algorithm. 

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a bit discouraged today. I think I just need to read more about the logic of loops, and how they store information and iterate.

### R1D21: 1/29/18

**Today's Progress**:  I went back to the previous algorithms and worked through them. Now I'm on an algorithm to create a sentence with title case.

**Thoughts:** I'm better understanding for loops, which feels good.

### R1D22: 1/30/18

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through an algorithm to find the longest word in a string and to title case a string, and went back and edited a couple previous algorithms to make them more efficient. I had to look up a couple hints, but it was mainly due to needing methods that I hadn't already learned.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm slowly getting better. I still have an incredible amount of things to learn, but I feel just a little bit closer.

### R1D23: 1/31/18

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through algorithms using .substr() and .repeat().

**Thoughts:** They were simpler algorithms, but I'm feeling accomplished. 

### R1D24: 2/1/18

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through algorithms to truncate a string and to divide one array into a multi-dimensional array.

**Thoughts:** I was nearly able to do these two without looking up answers. I knew what methods I needed to use and where to include them in the code, but I'm still lacking on syntax knowledge.

### R1D25: 2/2/18

**Today's Progress**:  Tried to solve an algorithm to no avail.

**Thoughts:** Sigh. On the plus side, I've made it a quarter of the way through my challenge.

### R1D26: 2/3/18

**Today's Progress**:  I solved an algorithm without looking at any hints! It is to determine where a number fits into a numerically-sorted array, and then return its index.

**Thoughts:** After my previous day of frustration (mostly with .filter() and callback functions - I really need help understanding these), this makes me feel better. I'm still totally struggling with understanding .filter() and its proper syntax and capabilities.

### R1D27: 2/4/18

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on and completed an ROT13 algorithm. Now moving onto basics of JSON and Ajax.

**Thoughts:** I am definitely going to need to review the JavaScript algorithms, but I want to give my brain something else to think about for a bit. I'll probably review them before or as I work on the intermediate front end development projects.

### R1D28: 2/5/18

**Today's Progress**:  Reviewed the remaining pages on JSON and Ajax on freeCodeCamp and began thinking about my first intermediate project: random quote generator.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get much actual coding done, but I took time to consider the type of quote machine I want to create so that I'm personally invested. I'm looking forward to getting it started.

### R1D29: 2/6/18

**Today's Progress**: I began the Random Quote Machine project. I wanted to get the basic HTML and CSS (for layout) set up. I read some tutorials on CSS Grid and implemented basic ideas from them.

**Thoughts**: While I'm barely scratching the surface of CSS Grid and Flexbox, it felt good to get a basic handle on it and see the layout changing as I played with the code. I'm sure I will make lots of changes as I clean it up. It was also nice to have more time to code today. I spent about 5 hours coding and reading tutorials.

### R1D30: 2/7/18

**Today's Progress**: I got the random quote functionality to work! The JavaScript was easier than I expected. So, currently, when you first visit the page it starts at a random quote, and then every time the "New Quote" button is pressed it displays a new one. I decided to use a nested array with the quote and author as separate object properties instead of accessing an API. I moved onto trying to implement the tweeting functionality and got really stuck, so I'm learning more about AJAX and JSON.

**Thoughts**: I am so excited that the JavaScript works! It's the simplest thing, but it felt awesome to see it working live. The JSON and AJAX stuff was feeling overwhelming, but as I'm going through a simple video tutorial I'm already understanding it a bit better.

**Link to Work:** [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/ZrpLdJ)

### R1D31: 2/8/18

**Today's Progress**: I'm using Udacity's Intro to AJAX minicourse to learn about AJAX and JSON so I can continue with my quote machine. I worked through some of the tutorial -- I successfully accessed data from Google Street View Image API and now I'm working on the New York Times Article Search API.

**Thoughts**: It's slowly starting to make sense...having the Street View Image API work was really awesome. Again, simple, but it felt so good to test it out and see it really work.

### R1D32: 2/9/18

**Today's Progress**: I successfully accessed the NY Times Article Search API with the tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if this is enough experience to try the Twitter API out, but I'm going to give it a shot. I at least seem to understand how JSON data is accessed now, which is better than two days ago!

### R1D33: 2/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on implementing a Tweet Web Intent from Twitter's dev docs. Running into trouble getting the text of the tweet showing up...but the hashtags load fine.

**Thoughts**: I realized halfway through that I didn't actually need to send an AJAX request to do what I needed to do...so I felt kind of dumb. I finally found the proper documentation on Twitter's dev site, which helped, but I'm still having trouble getting it properly coded. It's frustrating. I might code more tonight but I think I need to step away from it for a bit.

### R1D34: 2/11/18

**Today's Progress**: I got the Tweet Web Intent to work! Rookie mistake: I wasn't calling the function properly! So since I got that working, I was able to start styling the page.

**Thoughts**: I'm so excited that I got the tweet functionality to work properly! I just needed a fresh mind after being frustrated and feeling stuck yesterday.

**Link to Work:** [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/ZrpLdJ)

### R1D35: 2/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on styling the page for Random Quote Machine. I am trying to figure out some positioning issues - but other than that, the project is done.

**Thoughts**: The positioning issues are slightly frustrating, but I know that it's because I don't fully understand Flexbox and Grid yet.

**Link to Work:** [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/ZrpLdJ)

### R1D36: 2/13/18

**Today's Progress**: Quote Machine: I made minor changes to the layout + implemented basic responsive design using media queries, though it's not comprehensive. I'm considering the project complete for now, and I've moved onto the next freeCodeCamp challenge -- "Show the Local Weather."

**Thoughts**: I feel really good about the quote machine! Functionally it works, which is a great feeling. I like the look of it too. I tested it on different iOS devices that I have available to me and it doesn't look quite right on my older iPad mini. I'd eventually like to fix it, but that means taking a deeper dive into CSS layout design. It's something I want to learn for sure, but I'll come back to it.

**Link to Work:** [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/ZrpLdJ)

### R1D37: 2/14/18

**Today's Progress**: I spent a long time coding yesterday and set up my JavaScript to receive and display the appropriate JSON data for my weather app. Today I built upon it; I worked on the function to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

**Thoughts**: Now that I'm doing a bit more JavaScript I'm feeling the learning curve a bit. However, it's going MUCH more smoothly. I can tell that I better understand documentation. So, it feels good. I think I need to spend a lot more time looking at documentation so I can better understand JavaScript and jQuery's capabilities.

### R1D38: 2/15/18

**Today's Progress**: I completed the function to toggle between F and C on my weather app! It took a while and a lot of trial and error. I also cleaned up my JavaScript - got rid of unnecessary snippets, consolidated where I could and where I knew how.

**Thoughts**: Getting a continuous toggle between C and F literally made me cackle like a super-villain. I know that's super dorky, but when I get JavaScript/jQuery to work it's almost like an adrenaline rush. I am looking forward to making the app pretty over the next couple of days.

**Link to Work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/gvxgdw)

### R1D39: 2/17/18

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a function with a switch statement to get the replacement icons to show up on the page. In theory it works. but I'm having trouble with them displaying. It seems to be based on the filetype - a PNG worked while a SVG currently does not, but I want to use SVG. Need to figure out what's different about what I need to do.

**Thoughts**: A little annoyed that I can't get the SVG from Github to display properly, but I'm at least proud of the function I wrote!

**Link to Work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/gvxgdw)

### R1D40: 2/18/18

**Today's Progress**: I read a bit more about SVG with no success, so I decided to use PNG versions of the icons. These display successfully.

**Thoughts**: I'm definitely going to have to learn more about SVG. But for now I just want to move on with this project.

**Link to Work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/gvxgdw)

### R1D41: 2/19/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished styling the weather app!

**Thoughts**: Happy to have this marked off!

**Link to Work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/gvxgdw)

### R1D42: 2/20/18

**Today's Progress**: I went back and finished Udacity's Intro to AJAX course so I could have an introduction to using the Wikipedia API, which is involved in freeCodeCamp's next project. I learned how to use .ajax() instead of .getJSON(), which is what I used in the weather app.

**Thoughts**: I wish did more actual coding today, but this was helpful. I look forward to starting my project tomorrow.

### R1D43: 2/21/18

**Today's Progress**: I started setting up the Wikipedia Search page with some HTML and CSS. Learned about forms and styling them.

**Thoughts**: I have an idea of how I want the page to look; I really want to work on the design of the page for this project, as that was pushed a bit to the side in the last app.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D44: 2/22/18

**Today's Progress**: I got a successful response from my AJAX requests to the Wikipedia API and are triggered at the appropriate time; now working on getting the proper data to display.

**Thoughts**: I'm kind of unsure of how to go about what I want to do, but I know it exists somewhere.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D45: 2/23/18

**Today's Progress**: Nothing. I am stuck on getting the results to append properly to the HTML. In Chrome, they show up and then disappear after a moment.

**Thoughts**: I'm so incredibly frustrated. This is my first big annoying bug in any of my projects.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D46: 2/24/18

**Today's Progress**: I needed a break from that bug, so I decided to visit something on my to-do list: reading more in-depth about HTML hierarchy and semantic HTML. I worked on a practice page for this.

**Thoughts**: It's nice to take a break from a problem that's bugging me. 

### R1D47: 2/26/18

**Today's Progress**: Finally progressed on my Wikipedia page! The lovely people of Twitter helped me out and told me what was messed up with my code. Fixed it and continued on!

**Thoughts**: I love how supportive Twitter is! It was really lovely. It really was a simple oversight (the type of button I was using was messing things up!), but having that community is priceless. Also -- whoops, I missed more than 1 day within 14 days. I'm gonna tack on a couple days at the end AND practice extra this week.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D48: 2/27/18

**Today's Progress**: I went through Thinkful's trial course, learning more about semantic HTML and a11y issues. Refactored code I had written for the course previously to account for some a11y needs.

**Thoughts**: I am testing out Thinkful's trial because I am considering studying with them, and so far it's good. I do appreciate having things written out thoroughly, but at the same time it isn't overwhelming -- though that might be due to the fact I already feel pretty comfortable with HTML basics.

### R1D49: 2/28/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on styling my Wikipedia app. Still working on it, but having a good time. Realizing I'll need to add some JavaScript to let the Enter key also mean submitting the Go button.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling like I'm piecemealing CSS, where I want to have a better understanding of certain concepts, like Grid and Flexbox. It's all still on my to-do list! I need to maybe commit like an entire weekend day to learning them.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D50: 3/1/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked through some of Thinkful's CSS lessons. I read about the basics of CSS and played with font, background, and image properties. I also learned what border-box is!

**Thoughts**: I know a bit of this stuff already, but it was good to review the basics of CSS. I learned some new things, which feels good, however simple it may be.

### R1D51: 3/2/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked through more CSS lessons on Thinkful. I learned about making gradients and shadows!

**Thoughts**: I'm trying to get through their trial lesson before my two weeks are up. Feeling good about that.

### R1D52: 3/3/18

**Today's Progress**: I learned about the different types of CSS selectors on Thinkful and did some drills to practice them. I played around on [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) to learn about other selectors not covered.

**Thoughts**: I'm realizing how powerful CSS can be. It's pretty cool.

### R1D53: 3/4/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on some CSS layout lessons on Thinkful, mainly using the display property. Horizontal alignment was discussed as well. I ended the session with doing an exercise to code a design that Thinkful provided.

**Thoughts**: I'm starting to get the more basic, fundamental understanding of CSS that I desired.

### R1D54: 3/5/18

**Today's Progress**: I read about the position property, and then attempted to work on a layout challenge on Thinkful. I got part of the way there - Thinkful challenges us to spend an hour or less; I've got about 40 minutes in.

**Thoughts**: Whew! I definitely need practice with the position property.

### R1D55: 3/6/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished the layout challenge on Thinkful. I was having trouble positioning the cat and dog (click link for reference) but realized I needed to structure the HTML differently.

**Thoughts**: This was...very important work. Link below.


**Link to Work:** [Position Property Drill](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)http://lafriedel.repl.co/position-property-drill/)

### R1D56: 3/7/18

**Today's Progress**: I began Thinkful's "from design to code" challenge. They've provided a design of a search results page and I have to code it to match.

**Thoughts**: They want us to spend no more than 3 hours on this - about an hour in, I'm feeling fairly close. I just have some layout issues to figure out.

### R1D57: 3/8/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the challenge from the previous day. I've basically got it, but there's some weird things going on in my nav and with my button that I've gotta figure out.

**Thoughts**: I seem to understand CSS styling fairly well, it's just layout positioning that I'm still struggling with.

### R1D58: 3/9/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the challenge from the previous day. I solved most of the issues, but probably in not the best ways.

**Thoughts**: Still having a stubborn button that won't style. I don't get it!

**Link to Work**: [Greg's List](https://repl.it/@lafriedel/Gregslist)

### R1D59: 3/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Greg's List project. Looked over Thinkful's solution and did an informal code review on my own work. I then spent time reviewing the poisition and display properties.

**Thoughts**: Position and display properties are things I'll need to keep working on. Also, I think I need to get better at structuring my HTML better so that CSS makes more sense and lets my project potentially be scalable.

**Link to Work**: [Greg's List](https://repl.it/@lafriedel/Gregslist)

### R1D60: 3/11/18

**Today's Progress**: I decided to head back to Codepen and finish up my Wikipedia project. I fixed up the styling; I attempted to write an Enter-key-as-submit function but having trouble getting it to implement. 

**Thoughts**: I'd like to get the Enter key function to work, but I'm also not too worried about it. Trying to not learn everything at once. Baby steps.

**Link to Work**: [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D61: 3/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I began the last intermediate freeCodeCamp front-end project, which is accessing and displaying information from TwitchTV's API. I must display which streams are currently live, plus some other details. I set up some basic HTML and started playing with the API data.

**Thoughts**: The daylight savings transition has my brain moving a bit slower this morning...whew.

### R1D62: 3/13/18

**Today's Progress**: I wrote some jQuery functions to start collecting and displaying data. 

**Thoughts**: I have an error somewhere. It has something to do with the last index of the username array displaying when I append the HTML, though the data is displaying correctly. I'm working on this pretty late in the night, so I'm gonna revisit it fresh in the morning.

**Link to Work**: [TwitchTV Streaming Status](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/RMPmJK)

### R1D63: 3/15/18

**Today's Progress**: I tried to debug the issue from the previous day with no success. I do know where it's happening, but I don't know how to fix it. 

**Thoughts**: Kind of frustrating to not know how to fix this issue. But, I feel empowered knowing where it is - I'm sure it's a very simple fix. I'm sure some digging on the internet will reveal the answer. :)

**Link to Work**: [TwitchTV Streaming Status](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/RMPmJK)

### R1D64: 3/17/18

**Today's Progress**: I fixed my issue! All by myself! I wrote slightly different -- and more efficient -- code to get the results I wanted. :) So got the JavaScript to where I wanted it, and started working on CSS styling.

**Thoughts**: I feel so happy that I was able to edit my code to get the result I wanted! I'm getting better and more knowledgeable and it just feels great.

**Link to Work**: [TwitchTV Streaming Status](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/RMPmJK)

### R1D65: 3/18/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the Twitch TV API project.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad I got this done! I wanted to get this project done this week but wasn't sure I would. This is the last intermediate web development project on freeCodeCamp until I get to the advanced ones, which is kinda crazy!

**Link to Work**: [TwitchTV Streaming Status](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/RMPmJK)

### R1D66: 3/19/18

**Today's Progress**: I figured out my first intermediate algorithm - being provided a low and high number; determining the numbers between them, and then adding them all together. It utilized Math.min(), Math.max(), a for loop, and .reduce().

**Thoughts**: I'm really proud of myself for figuring out the solution without looking at any hints! 

### R1D67: 3/20/18

**Today's Progress**: I attempted to figure out the next intermediate algorithm: "Diff Two Arrays," with no solution. I got a solution that works in some instances, but not all.

**Thoughts**:  I was hoping my progress would be as smooth as yesterday, but I realize it's not always going to be like that. Sometimes I'm going to struggle for a while. I'm hoping some sleep will help me approach this with fresh eyes tomorrow.

### R1D68: 3/21/18

**Today's Progress**: I continued to try solutions for the algorithm. Didn't work - I peeked at the answer and I'm going to try coding it from scratch tomorrow. I also spent time earlier in the day going through all my open tabs and truly looking at them and adding them to the Resources page I created on this repo.

**Thoughts**:  Feeling like I really need to read about Javascript fundamentals. I never really read through MDN's intro to JS and I feel like it will help. 

### R1D69: 3/22/18 + 3/23/18

**Today's Progress**: Really no good progress - I'm combining two calendar days into one 100 Days of Code day, because I only worked for about 30 minutes each day. I was really unfocused, had headaches both days, and didn't make really any progress. I tried working on a Roman Numeral conversion algorithm and when I got frustrated with that, I tried watching some of Wes Bos' Javascript30 and I had trouble focusing. I really just needed to go to bed.

**Thoughts**:  I think I need to not code so late in the evening. I'm not a night owl. I waited until about 9pm on these days and it just isn't going to work for me.

### R1D70: 3/24/18

**Today's Progress**: I continued trying to work on the Roman Numerals algorithm, couldn't figure it out and looked at examples. But I'm really trying to understand it before I continue onto anything else.

**Thoughts**: Doing it in the morning is much better! I guess I need to be consistent about that. I'm still thinking I need to read more about JS fundamentals.

### R1D71: 3/25/18

**Today's Progress**: I went back and re-coded the Roman Numerals algorithm and wrote out some pseudocode in my notebook until I understood what was happening. I then moved onto freeCodeCamp's next algorithm, which looks through an array of objects and checks it against a key/value pair. It looks for a match, and then needs to return the match if it exists.

**Thoughts**: I'm still working on the code, but feeling focused and good about my attempts at it. I'm thinking I need to read more about Objects.

### R1D72: 3/26/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked through freeCodeCamp's "Wherefore Art Thou" algorithm and did the same thing - wrote out pseudocode and really tried to understand the step-by-step. I utilized jsfiddle for this, as it's easy to see the console.logs.

**Thoughts**: I like this new process I have of using jsfiddle to work things out. It's helping me see the logic of algorithm construction. 

### R1D73: 3/28/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked through freeCodeCamp's "Search and Replace" algorithm all on my own! Had to research how to do certain snippets of the code, but I knew how to figure it out without peeking.

**Thoughts**: Proud of myself. :)

### R1D74: 3/31/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked through freeCodeCamp's "Pig Latin" algorithm and I've nearly solved it. The only thing I'm missing is to push the first two characters to the back, rather than just the first, if the word starts with two consonants (like "glove"). So close!

**Thoughts**: Really happy to have known how to construct the algorithm 90% of the way there, without hints. Going to try to finish it up tomorrow without looking for any hints.

### R1D75: 4/1/18

**Today's Progress**: I read through some resources that I had saved on my Resources page, namely the article "Why Is Learning to Code So Damn Hard?" I also signed up for and played around on Code Wars.

**Thoughts**: Even though it was late in the evening and my brain wasn't totally ready to do some coding, I'm glad I set aside some time to study.

### R1D76: 4/2/18

**Today's Progress**: I took part in the first day of Lambda School's mini bootcamp - we learned how to use the command line and push to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: I've had issues with the command line in the past so taking time to figure out my issues was awesome. I can now appropriately push to my GitHub account. Looking forward to tomorrow.

### R1D77: 4/3/18

**Today's Progress**: Participated in day 2 of Lambda School's mini bootamp - learned about HTML and CSS. Also worked on some basic homework from the previous day - pushing to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: It was basically just a review for me today - s'ok; I'm looking forward to the Javascript portion of the bootcamp.

### R1D78: 4/4/18

**Today's Progress**: Participated in day 3 of Lambda School's mini bootamp - learned about CSS positioning. I also worked on the previous day's homework - just some basic editing of HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts**: Again, mostly a review but I did learn more about Flexbox which was helpful!

### R1D79: 4/5/18

**Today's Progress**: Participated in day 4 of Lambda School's mini bootcamp - intro to Javascript. Learned about ES6 syntax changes/additions, and different ways to create functions. I also worked on the previous day's homework, which dealt with the position and display properties, as well as manipulating elements with flexbox.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to be taught Javascript basics with someone talking and a visual aid. I really think this will help me grasp any basic foundation knowledge of Javascript that I initially missed.

### R1D80: 4/6/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my homework for the Lambda School mini-bootcamp. It wasn't typing actual code, but writing out explanations of fundamental Javascript terms as if we were explaining it to a 12-year-old. We're also supposed to set up Node but I'm waiting for my new laptop (!!!) to arrive.

**Thoughts**: This assignment is helping me flesh out my understanding of these terms.

### R1D81: 4/7/18

**Today's Progress**: What an exhilarating day! I got a new laptop so I got set up git and installed Node + npm. Then I did Lambda School's Day 4 homework, which was completing simple Javascript functions and then running them through a test with npm via Terminal. I proceeded to get kind of lost inside Terminal, temporarily broke some things (I did something weird to my .gitconfig file, but figured out how to reaccess it to fix the problem), but then finally was able to pass the test and push everything to GitHub!

**Thoughts**: I'm still so intimidated by the command line but now I'm kind of obsessed. I feel more empowered every time I search the messages if I get errors. It was so cool to see the results of the test - which functions passed, and which failed.

### R1D82: 4/8/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished up my Feynman writing prompts for Javascript and pushed it to GitHub. Then I helped out on a Squarespace website by integrating some custom HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed playing around with Squarespace a bit. I know I will be eventually building websites from scratch, but I think it's important to know in case I ever design or manage any websites with it.

### R1D83: 4/9/18

**Today's Progress**: Today I watched Lambda School's second Javascript class. We covered comparison operators, truthy/falsy, the difference between undefined and null, control flow, and logical operators.

**Thoughts**: Whew! What a great review. It's a review but really a more comprehensive (for me) return to some of the fundamentals I missed. I now have a better understanding of truthy vs. falsy, as well as undefined vs. null.


### R1D84: 4/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I watched Lambda School's Precourse day 6. We learned about Javascript arrays, for loops, and a few array methods. I also learned about the 'arguments' keyword.

**Thoughts**: Even though some of this stuff is a review, it feels really good when something I didn't know about becomes part of the lesson! I love knowing about the 'arguments' keyword.


### R1D85: 4/11/18

**Today's Progress**: Today I listened in Lambda School's Precourse day 7. We learned about objects and for...in loops.

**Thoughts**: I hadn't ever known about for...in loops. They're pretty cool! Also, learning about creating new methods in objects was kind of mindblowing.


### R1D86: 4/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I started working on the homework for this week's Lambda School Precourse lessons. It involved writing more functions and running them through npm tests. I then listened in on this week's last lesson. We learned about creating classes, the 'this' keyword, and the prototype.

**Thoughts**: So interesting! I feel like I'm learning more about Javascript in these past few days than I have in the whole time I've been doing #100DaysOfCode.

### R1D87: 4/14/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Lambda School's homework - writing more Javascript functions and running them through npm tests. 

**Thoughts**: In each assignment I'm left with like one or two functions that don't pass - I'm having trouble solving them and it's frustrating!

### R1D88: 4/16/18

**Today's Progress**: Sat in on the ninth Lambda School lesson, where we learned about callback functions.

**Thoughts**: The layering within callback functions is where my brain starts to work a little slower. It's gonna be a little bit before I grasp this, and that's ok!

### R1D89: 4/17/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Lambda School's homework - writing more Javascript functions and running them through npm tests. I solved the functions from last week that I was having trouble with, and moving onto later lessons.

**Thoughts**: Struggling a bit with functions using objects and callback functions - but I know it just takes practice.

### R1D90: 4/18/18

**Today's Progress**: I learned about recursion today via Lambda School!

**Thoughts**: I was intimidated by the idea of recursion but seeing it broken down into detailed steps really helped. I feel like I can approach it now. Whether I can actually build correct recursive code is another story, but I feel empowered. The comparison to Russian nesting dolls was really helpful for me.

### R1D91: 4/19/18

**Today's Progress**: I sat in on the last lesson of Lambda School's mini bootcamp - we learned about the DOM.

**Thoughts**: It was a good reminder that "document" looks like HTML when you console.log it but it's actually a "Javascript copy" of it. I think I explained that right!

### R1D92: 4/20/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Lambda School's homework, mainly lesson 07 concerning objects. I completed the assignment and pushed it to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling more comfortable with Javascript now. Still, I'm a beginniner, but I just feel more confident going into it. I'm less freaked out when code doesn't initially work; I feel like I solve it faster too. Not always, but I know how/where to look for answers.

### R1D93: 4/22/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished Lambda School lesson 08 homework and started working on lesson 09. The lessons involve Javascript classes and callback functions.

**Thoughts**: Callbacks are starting to make a bit more sense to me now. The complicated ones still feel pretty abstract to me, but I think writing out Feynman prompts on these terms will help as well.

### R1D94: 4/23/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished lesson 09 of the Lambda School homework (callback functions) and I began looking at lesson 10. Lessons 10-12 include closure and recursion.

**Thoughts**: Slowly, slowly, callback functions are making more sense. I coded early in the morning for the first time in a while and I think that really helped with my problem solving. I do think my mind is best suited for coding in the mornings.
