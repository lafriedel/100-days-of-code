# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: 1/8/18

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the freeCodeCamp exercises. Got up to integrating Bootstrap into the first project, the CatPhotoApp.

**Thoughts:** Everything covered so far has been basically a review for me, but I'm glad to have it. I'm looking forward to working past the stuff I already know.

### R1D2: 1/9/18

**Today's Progress**: Got through the Bootstrap and jQuery intro on freeCodeCamp, and I'm just about to start my first CodePen project as part of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was my first experience with jQuery, so even though it was super basic I feel good. I need to think of who I'd like to feature on my CodePen project, which is a tribute page.

### R1D3: 1/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I began doing research and setting up the HTML structure for my tribute page. Unsurprisingly (to people who know me), this tribute page is about parrots.

**Thoughts:** Coding a project is very different than doing exercises. I sat down to start coding it and I was like, "wait, what do I do?" But now that I'm mostly set up with some very basic HTML, I'm looking forward to making it a little more sophisticated and customizing it with CSS.

### R1D4: 1/11/18

**Today's Progress**: I started styling my tribute page with custom CSS as well as some Bootstrap styles. I used some things learned in freeCodeCamp as well as researched how to do some new things.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good - I'd like to finish this project up tomorrow so I can move on. I'm struggling to figure out how to best position the title font so that it layer over the header image and can be properly responsive, and that caught me up a bit.

### R1D5: 1/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished up my tribute page project; I utilized a bit more Bootstrap. I then began the personal portfolio page project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I did figure out eventually how to layer the text over the image, but realized it wasn't a good solution. I came up with a new solution for the page header that I'm happy with. It felt good to finish a project, even though it was very simple and small.

### R1D6: 1/13/18

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Bootstrap today to add content to my personal portfolio page.  

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying seeing how code works and doesn't work. It's like a puzzle.

### R1D7: 1/14/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with Bootstrap. Began implementing Bootstrap forms and nav. Also learned more about customizing Font Awesome icons.  

**Thoughts:** 7-day streak! Yay! I really like Bootstrap. I appreciate its ease of use and it's ability to be easily customized.

### R1D8: 1/15/18

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio page: Correctly coded my hero image with text layering and added in-page navigation.

**Thoughts:** Slightly frustrated with the hero image. I tried adding my headshot with my name and tagline next to it but I'm having trouble getting it to look right. The image size is mostly the issue. I want to spend time getting it to work properly.

### R1D9: 1/16/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** I feel like there are some general layout/positioning things in CSS that I need to better understand. That's mostly what I've been having trouble with in my coding. I wanted to finish up this project and move on for now, though; I do think I'll go back to these first two projects and rebuild them as my knowledge grows.

### R1D10: 1/17/18

**Today's Progress**: Began the Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Math! I like math. Javascript is definitely more challenging for me than HTML/CSS, and I'm looking forward to feeling comfortable with it. (Also, 10% of the way through 100 days!)

### R1D11: 1/18/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp: arrays, manipulating arrays, passing arguments into functions.

**Thoughts:** Ugh, I am stuck on a challenge involving queues. It's frustrating - Javascript definitely doesn't come as naturally to me as visual things like HTML and CSS. But I'm working on it - I absolutely want to understand and feel comfortable with Javascript.

### R1D12: 1/19/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp: more mathematical operators, if/else statements, and just beginning switch statements.

**Thoughts:** Feeling a bit more confident today. I caved and looked up the answer to the previous JS challenge. It was a simple solution; I'm thinking the wording of the challenge got me tripped up. Still, I should probably spend more time with .push() and .shift().

### R1D13: 1/20/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp: switch statements, returning boolean values, and working with objects.

**Thoughts:** It went ok today. I'm starting to understand the logic of JS a bit better. 

### R1D14: 1/21/18

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Javascript on freeCodeCamp. Today it was accessing information in objects, nested objects, and nested arrays, and I began working with for loops.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about it. Although I know when I get to the first project challenge using Javascript, there's going to be a dip in my confidence for sure! 

### R1D15: 1/22/18

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Javascript on freeCodeCamp. More work with for loops, nested for loops, while loops.

**Thoughts:** I'm realizing my logic is there, but my syntax/code isn't correct all the time. For example, I had to access a property within an array and I forgot that .hasOwnProperty exists, so I tried accessing it in a different way. But at least I knew I had to access it! I'm getting there.

### R1D16: 1/23/18

**Today's Progress**: Lots more work with Javascript. Worked with regular expressions and different array and string methods.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. But tomorrow starts the Javascript challenges, where one must solve the problems from scratch. Aye! I will get through it though.

### R1D17: 1/24/18

**Today's Progress**: I completed two algorithm challenges on freeCodeCamp. Reversing a string and factorializing a number.

**Thoughts:** ...I actually completed two challenges!! I looked up the answer afterwards to compare what I did - my code is a bit convoluted, but it got there! I'll get better and more efficient as time goes by and as I remember the full functionality of certain code.

### R1D18: 1/25/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a palindrome algorithm on freeCodeCamp. I'm nearly there. Still need to return a few different options as "true" that are currently returning "false."

**Thoughts:** My code is so not efficient. I guess I didn't realize I could combine multiple methods, for some reason. I'm going to return to the code tomorrow and clean it up.

### R1D19: 1/26/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked through a couple more algorithms in freeCodeCamp: Check for palindromes and find the longest word in a string.

**Thoughts:** Even though I got through them I had to look up lots of hints. I think I'm going to go back and redo some of these. Seems like I'm still not grasping some basic concepts. It might be helpful for me to do some supplemental reading as well.

### R1D20: 1/28/18

**Today's Progress**: I went back to the first algorithm to start working through them again. I want to make sure I understand the concepts without having to look up answer hints. I got through reversing a string, and I'm continuing to retry the factorializing algorithm. 

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling a bit discouraged today. I think I just need to read more about the logic of loops, and how they store information and iterate.

### R1D21: 1/29/18

**Today's Progress**:  I went back to the previous algorithms and worked through them. Now I'm on an algorithm to create a sentence with title case.

**Thoughts:** I'm better understanding for loops, which feels good.

### R1D22: 1/30/18

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through an algorithm to find the longest word in a string and to title case a string, and went back and edited a couple previous algorithms to make them more efficient. I had to look up a couple hints, but it was mainly due to needing methods that I hadn't already learned.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm slowly getting better. I still have an incredible amount of things to learn, but I feel just a little bit closer.

### R1D23: 1/31/18

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through algorithms using .substr() and .repeat().

**Thoughts:** They were simpler algorithms, but I'm feeling accomplished. 

### R1D24: 2/1/18

**Today's Progress**:  Worked through algorithms to truncate a string and to divide one array into a multi-dimensional array.

**Thoughts:** I was nearly able to do these two without looking up answers. I knew what methods I needed to use and where to include them in the code, but I'm still lacking on syntax knowledge.

### R1D25: 2/2/18

**Today's Progress**:  Tried to solve an algorithm to no avail.

**Thoughts:** Sigh. On the plus side, I've made it a quarter of the way through my challenge.

### R1D26: 2/3/18

**Today's Progress**:  I solved an algorithm without looking at any hints! It is to determine where a number fits into a numerically-sorted array, and then return its index.

**Thoughts:** After my previous day of frustration (mostly with .filter() and callback functions - I really need help understanding these), this makes me feel better. I'm still totally struggling with understanding .filter() and its proper syntax and capabilities.

### R1D27: 2/4/18

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on and completed an ROT13 algorithm. Now moving onto basics of JSON and Ajax.

**Thoughts:** I am definitely going to need to review the JavaScript algorithms, but I want to give my brain something else to think about for a bit. I'll probably review them before or as I work on the intermediate front end development projects.

### R1D28: 2/5/18

**Today's Progress**:  Reviewed the remaining pages on JSON and Ajax on freeCodeCamp and began thinking about my first intermediate project: random quote generator.

**Thoughts:** Didn't get much actual coding done, but I took time to consider the type of quote machine I want to create so that I'm personally invested. I'm looking forward to getting it started.

### R1D29: 2/6/18

**Today's Progress**: I began the Random Quote Machine project. I wanted to get the basic HTML and CSS (for layout) set up. I read some tutorials on CSS Grid and implemented basic ideas from them.

**Thoughts**: While I'm barely scratching the surface of CSS Grid and Flexbox, it felt good to get a basic handle on it and see the layout changing as I played with the code. I'm sure I will make lots of changes as I clean it up. It was also nice to have more time to code today. I spent about 5 hours coding and reading tutorials.

### R1D30: 2/7/18

**Today's Progress**: I got the random quote functionality to work! The JavaScript was easier than I expected. So, currently, when you first visit the page it starts at a random quote, and then every time the "New Quote" button is pressed it displays a new one. I decided to use a nested array with the quote and author as separate object properties instead of accessing an API. I moved onto trying to implement the tweeting functionality and got really stuck, so I'm learning more about AJAX and JSON.

**Thoughts**: I am so excited that the JavaScript works! It's the simplest thing, but it felt awesome to see it working live. The JSON and AJAX stuff was feeling overwhelming, but as I'm going through a simple video tutorial I'm already understanding it a bit better.

### R1D31: 2/8/18

**Today's Progress**: I'm using Udacity's Intro to AJAX minicourse to learn about AJAX and JSON so I can continue with my quote machine. I worked through some of the tutorial -- I successfully accessed data from Google Street View Image API and now I'm working on the New York Times Article Search API.

**Thoughts**: It's slowly starting to make sense...having the Street View Image API work was really awesome. Again, simple, but it felt so good to test it out and see it really work.

### R1D32: 2/9/18

**Today's Progress**: I successfully accessed the NY Times Article Search API with the tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I'm not sure if this is enough experience to try the Twitter API out, but I'm going to give it a shot. I at least seem to understand how JSON data is accessed now, which is better than two days ago!

### R1D33: 2/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on implementing a Tweet Web Intent from Twitter's dev docs. Running into trouble getting the text of the tweet showing up...but the hashtags load fine.

**Thoughts**: I realized halfway through that I didn't actually need to send an AJAX request to do what I needed to do...so I felt kind of dumb. I finally found the proper documentation on Twitter's dev site, which helped, but I'm still having trouble getting it properly coded. It's frustrating. I might code more tonight but I think I need to step away from it for a bit.

### R1D34: 2/11/18

**Today's Progress**: I got the Tweet Web Intent to work! Rookie mistake: I wasn't calling the function properly! So since I got that working, I was able to start styling the page.

**Thoughts**: I'm so excited that I got the tweet functionality to work properly! I just needed a fresh mind after being frustrated and feeling stuck yesterday.

### R1D35: 2/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I worked on styling the page for Random Quote Machine. I am trying to figure out some positioning issues - but other than that, the project is done.

**Thoughts**: The positioning issues are slightly frustrating, but I know that it's because I don't fully understand Flexbox and Grid yet.

### R1D36: 2/13/18

**Today's Progress**: Quote Machine: I made minor changes to the layout + implemented basic responsive design using media queries, though it's not comprehensive. I'm considering the project complete for now, and I've moved onto the next freeCodeCamp challenge -- "Show the Local Weather."

**Thoughts**: I feel really good about the quote machine! Functionally it works, which is a great feeling. I like the look of it too. I tested it on different iOS devices that I have available to me and it doesn't look quite right on my older iPad mini. I'd eventually like to fix it, but that means taking a deeper dive into CSS layout design. It's something I want to learn for sure, but I'll come back to it.

### R1D37: 2/14/18

**Today's Progress**: I spent a long time coding yesterday and set up my JavaScript to receive and display the appropriate JSON data for my weather app. Today I built upon it; I worked on the function to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

**Thoughts**: Now that I'm doing a bit more JavaScript I'm feeling the learning curve a bit. However, it's going MUCH more smoothly. I can tell that I better understand documentation. So, it feels good. I think I need to spend a lot more time looking at documentation so I can better understand JavaScript and jQuery's capabilities.

### R1D38: 2/15/18

**Today's Progress**: I completed the function to toggle between F and C on my weather app! It took a while and a lot of trial and error. I also cleaned up my JavaScript - got rid of unnecessary snippets, consolidated where I could and where I knew how.

**Thoughts**: Getting a continuous toggle between C and F literally made me cackle like a super-villain. I know that's super dorky, but when I get JavaScript/jQuery to work it's almost like an adrenaline rush. I am looking forward to making the app pretty over the next couple of days.

### R1D39: 2/17/18

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a function with a switch statement to get the replacement icons to show up on the page. In theory it works. but I'm having trouble with them displaying. It seems to be based on the filetype - a PNG worked while a SVG currently does not, but I want to use SVG. Need to figure out what's different about what I need to do.

**Thoughts**: A little annoyed that I can't get the SVG from Github to display properly, but I'm at least proud of the function I wrote!

**Link to Work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/gvxgdw)

### R1D40: 2/18/18

**Today's Progress**: I read a bit more about SVG with no success, so I decided to use PNG versions of the icons. These display successfully.

**Thoughts**: I'm definitely going to have to learn more about SVG. But for now I just want to move on with this project.

**Link to Work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/gvxgdw)

### R1D41: 2/19/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished styling the weather app!

**Thoughts**: Happy to have this marked off!

**Link to Work:** [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/gvxgdw)

### R1D42: 2/20/18

**Today's Progress**: I went back and finished Udacity's Intro to AJAX course so I could have an introduction to using the Wikipedia API, which is involved in freeCodeCamp's next project. I learned how to use .ajax() instead of .getJSON(), which is what I used in the weather app.

**Thoughts**: I wish did more actual coding today, but this was helpful. I look forward to starting my project tomorrow.

### R1D43: 2/21/18

**Today's Progress**: I started setting up the Wikipedia Search page with some HTML and CSS. Learned about forms and styling them.

**Thoughts**: I have an idea of how I want the page to look; I really want to work on the design of the page for this project, as that was pushed a bit to the side in the last app.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D44: 2/22/18

**Today's Progress**: I got a successful response from my AJAX requests to the Wikipedia API and are triggered at the appropriate time; now working on getting the proper data to display.

**Thoughts**: I'm kind of unsure of how to go about what I want to do, but I know it exists somewhere.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)

### R1D45: 2/23/18

**Today's Progress**: Nothing. I am stuck on getting the results to append properly to the HTML. In Chrome, they show up and then disappear after a moment.

**Thoughts**: I'm so incredibly frustrated. This is my first big annoying bug in any of my projects.

**Link to Work:** [Wikipedia Search](https://codepen.io/lafriedel/pen/VQdZqw)
