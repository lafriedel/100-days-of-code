# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: 1/8/18

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the freeCodeCamp exercises. Got up to integrating Bootstrap into the first project, the CatPhotoApp.

**Thoughts:** Everything covered so far has been basically a review for me, but I'm glad to have it. I'm looking forward to working past the stuff I already know.

### R1D2: 1/9/18

**Today's Progress**: Got through the Bootstrap and jQuery intro on freeCodeCamp, and I'm just about to start my first CodePen project as part of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was my first experience with jQuery, so even though it was super basic I feel good. I need to think of who I'd like to feature on my CodePen project, which is a feature page.
