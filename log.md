# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: 1/8/18

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the freeCodeCamp exercises. Got up to integrating Bootstrap into the first project, the CatPhotoApp.

**Thoughts:** Everything covered so far has been basically a review for me, but I'm glad to have it. I'm looking forward to working past the stuff I already know.

### R1D2: 1/9/18

**Today's Progress**: Got through the Bootstrap and jQuery intro on freeCodeCamp, and I'm just about to start my first CodePen project as part of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was my first experience with jQuery, so even though it was super basic I feel good. I need to think of who I'd like to feature on my CodePen project, which is a tribute page.

### R1D3: 1/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I began doing research and setting up the HTML structure for my tribute page. Unsurprisingly (to people who know me), this tribute page is about parrots.

**Thoughts:** Coding a project is very different than doing exercises. I sat down to start coding it and I was like, "wait, what do I do?" But now that I'm mostly set up with some very basic HTML, I'm looking forward to making it a little more sophisticated and customizing it with CSS.

### R1D4: 1/11/18

**Today's Progress**: I started styling my tribute page with custom CSS as well as some Bootstrap styles. I used some things learned in freeCodeCamp as well as researched how to do some new things.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good - I'd like to finish this project up tomorrow so I can move on. I'm struggling to figure out how to best position the title font so that it layer over the header image and can be properly responsive, and that caught me up a bit.

### R1D5: 1/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished up my tribute page project; I utilized a bit more Bootstrap. I then began the personal portfolio page project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I did figure out eventually how to layer the text over the image, but realized it wasn't a good solution. I came up with a new solution for the page header that I'm happy with. It felt good to finish a project, even though it was very simple and small.

### R1D6: 1/13/18

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Bootstrap today to add content to my personal portfolio page.  

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying seeing how code works and doesn't work. It's like a puzzle.

### R1D7: 1/14/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with Bootstrap. Began implementing Bootstrap forms and nav. Also learned more about customizing Font Awesome icons.  

**Thoughts:** 7-day streak! Yay! I really like Bootstrap. I appreciate its ease of use and it's ability to be easily customized.

### R1D8: 1/15/18

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio page: Correctly coded my hero image with text layering and added in-page navigation.

**Thoughts:** Slightly frustrated with the hero image. I tried adding my headshot with my name and tagline next to it but I'm having trouble getting it to look right. The image size is mostly the issue. I want to spend time getting it to work properly.

### R1D9: 1/16/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished up my personal portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** I feel like there are some general layout/positioning things in CSS that I need to better understand. That's mostly what I've been having trouble with in my coding. I wanted to finish up this project and move on for now, though; I do think I'll go back to these first two projects and rebuild them as my knowledge grows.

### R1D10: 1/17/18

**Today's Progress**: Began the Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Math! I like math. Javascript is definitely more challenging for me than HTML/CSS, and I'm looking forward to feeling comfortable with it. (Also, 10% of the way through 100 days!)

### R1D11: 1/18/18

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Javascript lessons on freeCodeCamp: arrays, manipulating arrays, passing arguments into functions.

**Thoughts:** Ugh, I am stuck on a challenge involving queues. It's frustrating - Javascript definitely doesn't come as naturally to me as visual things like HTML and CSS. But I'm working on it - I absolutely want to understand and feel comfortable with Javascript.
