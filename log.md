# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: 1/8/18

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the freeCodeCamp exercises. Got up to integrating Bootstrap into the first project, the CatPhotoApp.

**Thoughts:** Everything covered so far has been basically a review for me, but I'm glad to have it. I'm looking forward to working past the stuff I already know.

### R1D2: 1/9/18

**Today's Progress**: Got through the Bootstrap and jQuery intro on freeCodeCamp, and I'm just about to start my first CodePen project as part of freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** It was my first experience with jQuery, so even though it was super basic I feel good. I need to think of who I'd like to feature on my CodePen project, which is a tribute page.

### R1D3: 1/10/18

**Today's Progress**: I began doing research and setting up the HTML structure for my tribute page. Unsurprisingly (to people who know me), this tribute page is about parrots.

**Thoughts:** Coding a project is very different than doing exercises. I sat down to start coding it and I was like, "wait, what do I do?" But now that I'm mostly set up with some very basic HTML, I'm looking forward to making it a little more sophisticated and customizing it with CSS.

### R1D4: 1/11/18

**Today's Progress**: I started styling my tribute page with custom CSS as well as some Bootstrap styles. I used some things learned in freeCodeCamp as well as researched how to do some new things.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good - I'd like to finish this project up tomorrow so I can move on. I'm struggling to figure out how to best position the title font so that it layer over the header image and can be properly responsive, and that caught me up a bit.

### R1D5: 1/12/18

**Today's Progress**: I finished up my tribute page project; I utilized a bit more Bootstrap. I then began the personal portfolio page project from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I did figure out eventually how to layer the text over the image, but realized it wasn't a good solution. I came up with a new solution for the page header that I'm happy with. It felt good to finish a project, even though it was very simple and small.

### R1D6: 1/13/18

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Bootstrap today to add content to my personal portfolio page.  

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying seeing how code works and doesn't work. It's like a puzzle.
